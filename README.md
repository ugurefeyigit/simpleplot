## How to Use (.py file) !!! Make sure you've installed the required libraries!

1. Run the `simplePlot.py` script. This will open the Data Input window.
2. In the Data Input window, enter the number of data points, the labels and units for the x and y axes, and the plot name.
3. If you want a best fit line to be created for your data, check the "Create best fit line?" box.
4. Click the "Submit" button. This will hide the Data Input window and open a new window for entering your data.
5. In the new window, enter your data for the x and y axes.
